# YouTube Spam Detection Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a YouTube comment spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The primary aim is to identify and filter out spam comments on YouTube videos to enhance the user experience and maintain a clean comment section.

Usage
Data Preparation: Before model training, ensure that you've preprocessed the data. You can utilize the provided Jupyter notebooks or run the data preprocessing script in the src directory.

Model Training: Train the machine learning model with the cleaned data. You can refer to the model_training.ipynb notebook or use the model.py script located in the src directory.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using the evaluation notebook (Youtube_Spam_detection.ipynb) or execute the Youtube_Spam_detection.py script. Common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be employed to evaluate the model.

Data
The project relies on a dataset of YouTube comments, accessible in the data directory. The raw comment data is stored in repository, while the cleaned version is available in repository.csv. Ensure that you update the data files as needed to suit your specific use case.

Model Training
The machine learning model used for spam detection is implemented in the Youtube_Spam_detection.py script. You can customize the model architecture and hyperparameters within this file. To initiate model training, use the Youtube_Spam_detection.ipynb notebook or the script itself.

Evaluation
The Youtube_Spam_detection.py script, located in the src directory, contains code for evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset. Alternatively, you can utilize the Youtube_Spam_detection.ipynb notebook for a more interactive evaluation process.

Deployment
For deployment, consider various methods such as:
